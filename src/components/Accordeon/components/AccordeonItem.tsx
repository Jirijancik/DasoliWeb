        <article id="content-1"><p><em>Frans Hals the Elder (c. 1582 â€“ 26 August 1666)</em> was a Dutch Golden Age painter born in the Southern Netherlands (present-day Belgium). He is notable for his loose painterly brushwork, and helped introduce this lively style of painting into Dutch art. Hals was also instrumental in the evolution of 17th-century group portraiture.</p></article>
